# Auto Object Detection and Segmentation

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for object detection and segmentation using Ultralytics YOLO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). It is designed to work with any Roboflow dataset.

## Overview

- **Training:** Train a YOLO model on your chosen dataset.
- **Inference:** Run object detection on test images.
- **Segmentation:** Use SAM to segment detected objects.
